## Transformer based model to write python code

Goal : From the raw input file which contains English text and python code, curate a dataset and train a transformer model which can predict python code from the input text.

### Dataset Curation

### Word Embeddings for Python Code

### Model

### Sample Results
The applications of neural machine translation (NMT) to programming languages have been limited
so far, mainly because of the lack of parallel resources available in this domain.
