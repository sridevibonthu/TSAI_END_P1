## Transformer based model to write python code

Goal : From the raw input file which contains English text and python code, curate a dataset and train a transformer model which can predict python code from the input text.

### Dataset Curation

The initial dataset given is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rHb0FQ5z5ZpaY2HpyFGY6CeyDG0kTLoO/view , which can not be used directly for training the model. It needs lot of preprocessing.




### Word Embeddings for Python Code

### Model

### Sample Results
The applications of neural machine translation (NMT) to programming languages have been limited
so far, mainly because of the lack of parallel resources available in this domain.
